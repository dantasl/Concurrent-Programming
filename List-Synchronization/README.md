# List Synchronization

This project aims to implement a way to manage the use of a linked list, accross multiple threads that need to perform different actions, avoiding
starvation, deadlock and livelock.

# Running

I wrote this code using Eclipse, so you can simply import the project and run there. No extra arguments are needed.

Additionally, if you want to increase the number of threads (the default here is 3 by type), you can do that simply changing the value of NUM_THREADS constant,
available at the Main class.
