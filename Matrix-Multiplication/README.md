# Matrix Multiplication

This projetct aims to provide two ways to multiplicate matrices: sequential and concurrent.

## Inputs

The input matrices are located on the data folder, as text files. There are 20 files, 10 for each set of matrices (A and B).
Each file contains a square matrix.

## Outputs

After running the code, two outputs shall be generated: a file containing the resulting matrix from the multiplication and a file with the metrics.

## Running

In order to run the code, you must provide two valid arguments. First, the matrices to be multiplied. In order to do so, just type their dimension (e.g. 4, 
8, 16, etc.), all of them being a power of 2 number based.

Second, you need to inform if the code will be run with the sequential or the concurrent version. For that, your options are <code>C</code> (for Concurrent) and
<code>S</code> (for sequential).

This code was developed on Eclipse.
